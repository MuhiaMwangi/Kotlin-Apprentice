//Object-SINGLETON

//DECOMPILE this Kotlin bytecode to Java : Tools-> Kotlin->Show Kotlin Bytecode
//object keyword is used to create Singleton Object
//Singleton pattern restricts a class to have a single instance
//Type is the instance hence no need for constructors


object X {
    var x = 0
}
//Obs: Boilerplate code is significantly reduced by use of object keyword
